blktrace Timeline

Usage
-----

$ btt -i <input file> (-l | -m) [-d <range delta>] [-D <devices...>]
      [-e <executables...>] [-h] [-M map information] [-o <output file>]
      [-v] [-V]

You are required to:

o  Specify an input file (-i)

o  Specify MD (-m) or LVM2/DM (-l) devices present (If no software RAID
   devices, use -m.) This is a workaround for issues between LVM2 and MD
   remap events that needs to be cleaned up. [DM devices are not working
   as of right now, always specify -m for individual disks and/or MD
   devices.]

The -d argument allows you to specify the granularity which dtermines
"activity" with regard to the .dat files -- this specific the time
(in seconds) that must elapse without a particular event occuring to
signify inactivity. The larger the number, the fewer ranges output --
the default is 0.1 seconds.

The -D argument supplies the devices which should be looked at when
analyzing the input. This is a ":" separated list of devices, devices are
specified by a mjr,mnr tuple (e.g.: -D "8,0:8,8" specifies two devices
with major 8 and minor 0 and 8 respectively).

The -e argument supplies the list of executables that will have I/Os
analyzed.

The -M argument takes in a file generated by the provided script
(gen_disk_info.py), and allows for better output of device names.

Overview
--------

btt will take in binary dump data from blkparse, and analyze the events,
producing a series of output from the analysis. It will also build .dat
files containing "range data" -- showing things like Q activity (periods
of time while Q events are being produced), C activity (likewise for
command completions), and etc.
